<h2> This is a paragraph from an essay  I like </h2>
<h3> <em> The Kind of Light that Shines on Texas </em> </h3> 
<p> Nailor and Mrs. Wickham helped Oakley to his feet. His already fattened nose bled and swelled so that I had to look away. He looked around, bemused, walleyed, maybe scared. It was apparent he had no idea how bad he was hurt. He didn’t blink. He didn’t even touch his nose. He didn’t look like he
knew much of anything. He looked at me, looked me dead in the eye, in fact, but didn’t seem to recognize me.</p>
<h3> it's by Reginald McKnight. </h3>
<p>Pledge of Allegiance, sang The Yellow Rose of Texas,”“The Eyes of Texas Are upon You,” and “Mistress Shady.” The room stood strangely empty without Oakley, and without Marvin, but at the same time you could feel their presence more intensely somehow. I felt like I did when I’d walk into my mother’s room and could smell my father’s cigars or cologne. </p>
<h3> I love this part...</h3>
He was more palpable, in certain respects, than when there in actual flesh. For some reason, I turned to look at Ah- so, and just this once I let my eyes linger on her face. She had a very gentle-looking face, really. 
<p>That surprised me. She must have felt my eyes on her because she glanced up at me for a second and smiled, white teeth, downcast eyes. Such a pretty smile. </p>
